                        <P>A remote IPPBX (Internet Protocol Private Branch Exchange) is a type of telephone system that uses internet protocol (IP) technology to allow employees to make and receive calls from remote locations. It is a cloud-based solution that eliminates the need for a physical PBX (Private Branch Exchange) system, which is typically housed on-premise in a company's call center.</p>
