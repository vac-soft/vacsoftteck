                            customer can also be shared with required information to a senior or a support executive who
                            is required for that appointment. This helps the concerned executive to get prepared for the
                            scheduled meeting. You can even set a reminder. If you have a list of work to be attended by
                            an executive, the same can be prepared under `To Do Listâ€™ and can be marked to the
                            respective executive for execution.

                        <p class="mb-3 text-dark fs-5">Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is a term that refers to
                            practices, strategies and technologies to analyze customer interaction and data throughout
                            the customer life cycle.. The aim of CRM is to improve customer service relationships and
                            assist enterprises in customer retention and drive sales growth. VAC CRM software
                            consolidates customer information and documents into a single CRM database so that business
                            users can more easily access and manage it. Automating various work flow processes, such as
                            tasks, calendars and alerts, allows managers the ability to track performance and
                            productivity based on information logged within the system. Thus, VAC CRM, which is far more
                            than just a software application, help businesses optimize processes by streamlining mundane
                            workloads, enabling employees to focus on creative and more high-level tasks.</p>

                                prioritize, and manage those requests.</p>
